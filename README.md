## Deployment

- Hero Component live at: [View on Vercel](https://vercel.com/aaron-greenbergs-projects/v0-scatterbrain-hero-component)
- Build/modify in [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/chat/projects/3Y6syGYA3Nj)

Getting Started (for the full app)
Add the steps: clone repo, install pnpm, .env.local, run locally. (From my starter template.)

## How It Works

1. Develop and modify the core app locally (Next.js, Supabase, etc.)
2. Use [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) to create and sync additional UI components
3. Deploy automatically to Vercel
4. Monitor feedback and iterate
